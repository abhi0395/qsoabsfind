qsoabsfind's documentation
===========================

`qsoabsfind` is a Python module designed to detect absorbers with doublet properties in SDSS/DESI quasar spectra. This tool identifies potential absorbers using a convolution-based adaptive S/N approach, applies Gaussian fitting and extensive checks to reject false positives, and computes equivalent widths (EWs) of the lines using a simple double Gaussian.

Currently, the package only works for **MgII 2796,2803** and **CIV 1548,1550** doublets.

Features
--------

- Convolution-based adaptive S/N approach for detecting absorbers in QSO spectra.
- Gaussian fitting for accurate measurement of absorber properties (such as EW, line widths, and centers).
- Parallel processing using multiprocessing for efficient computation on a large number of spectra.
